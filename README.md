## Local development

This repository is a pnpm workspace (SDK at the root, docs site in `web/`).

```bash

## Styling Setup

On top of using your own CSS framework, the SDK also mainly uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Follow this step to set up styling in your project:

Import the SDK's CSS in your app's entry point (e.g., app.tsx, index.tsx, or layout.tsx):

```tsx
import "jupiverse-kit/dist/styles.css";
```
