## Development Guidelines

This repository uses **pnpm** as the only package manager. From the repo root:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm dev:web
```

Do not use npm or yarn — they will create conflicting lockfiles.

To maintain code quality and consistency:

- Write clean, typed code using TypeScript
- Follow React best practices and hooks guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Maintain compatibility with peer dependencies:
  - React ≥ 16.8.0
  - React DOM ≥ 16.8.0
  - @solana/web3.js ≥ 1.91.3
- Follow existing code style and formatting conventions
- Include tests for new functionality where applicable
